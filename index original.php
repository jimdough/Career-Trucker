 <h1>The state of the trucking industry today and in the future</h1>

	<p>Truck driving jobs are going to remain in the United States unlike many other jobs that can be outsourced to other countries. More importantly, the trucking industry is actively seeking drivers and is ready to hire. The trucking industry is actively entering a period in which more drivers are needed to move freight. Driving jobs are available now and predicted to be in high demand far into the future. This year alone, the truck driving industry is expecting a shortage of 200,000 drivers. In 2012, the shortage is predicted to reach 400,000 drivers.</p>

	<p>There will always be a need to move freight and consequently a need for professional truck drivers to move that freight. Over the years, a common misconception has developed that the industry is old fashioned and stuck in the past. That impression couldn't be further from the truth. Heres why:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>The average salary of truck drivers is greater than many other occupations that require similar skill levels and training requirements including construction workers, heavy equipment operators and forklift operators.</li>

	<li>A majority of professional drivers are able to get home weekly to their families</li>

	<li>Trucking is a high-tech industry and the use of computers and trucking software is extremely popular. The top trucking companies are constantly upgrading trucks with better systems, improved aerodynamics and stronger and lighter materials.</li>

	<li>The transportation industry comprises more than 10 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, which is approximately $1.4 trillion.</li>

	<li>82% of the money spent on transportation in the United States is spent in the trucking industry</li>

	<li>Truck drivers haul 71 percent of all freight moved throughout the U.S.</li>

	<li>The trucking industry employs one in every 19 people in the U.S.</li>

	<li>More than 80 percent of all U.S. communities depend solely on trucking for delivery of their goods and commodities</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>What if the trucks don't move?</h1>
	<ul>
	<li>The country would experience food shortages in three days</li>
	<li>NO drinking water in 2 to 4 weeks</li>
	<li>NO large scale emergency medical supplies</li>
	<li>NO automobile travel after 1 week</li>
	<li>NO cash at ATM machines in two days</li>
	<li>Widespread trash and sanitation problems</li>
	</ul>
