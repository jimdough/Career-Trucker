	<h1>What kind of health conditions could potentially keep you from getting a CDL license?</h1>

	<p>The federal regulations mandate the health regulations for drivers. You must have what they call a DOT physical exam every 2 years. In order to pass that exam you would have to meet the federal requirements for doing so.</p>

	<h1>What conditions might prevent you from passing the physical exam?</h1>

	<p>Some things that would keep you from passing that exam might be bad eyesight, I think 20/40 vision in both eyes is the requirement and in each eye, so if you're blind in one eye and 20/20 in the other, you would still would not meet the federal regulation to pass the physical. Other things such as diabetes and so on would preclude you from passing the DOT physical.</p>

	<h1>What are some of the new health requirements to be aware of that might prevent you from getting a CDL license?</h1>

	<p>Heart problems are just now beginning to surface as part of the physical requirements, they're not definitive yet. Something else on the horizon is sleep apnea, nothing specific yet, but they're working on it, and it probably will be coming. That is sometimes based on the BMI Body Mass Index, you would have to have a certain BMI in order to pass the physical.</p>
